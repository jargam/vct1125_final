       <h4>What foods are in the Dairy Group?</h4>
       <br />
        <p class="main-p">
            The Dairy Group includes milk, yogurt, cheese, lactose-free milk and fortified soy milk and yogurt. It does not include foods made from milk that have little calcium and a high fat content, such as cream cheese, sour cream, cream, and butter.</p>

         <h4>Importance of Dairy</h4>  
         <br /> 
         <br /> 
         
         <p>Consuming dairy products provides health benefits — especially building and maintaining strong bones. Foods in the Dairy Group provide nutrients that are vital for health and maintenance of your body. These nutrients include calcium, potassium, vitamin D, and protein.

                Health Benefits</h4>  
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
           
            <p>
                Calcium and vitamin D are important nutrients at any age. Intake of dairy products that contain these nutrients help to:

                Improve bone health especially in children and adolescents, when bone mass is being built.
                Promote bone health and prevent the onset of osteoporosis in adults, most of whom do not get enough of these nutrients.

            <h4>Daily Intake</h4>  
            <br /> 
            <br /> 
            
            <p>
                The amount of dairy you need depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and level of physical activity. For women, the amount can also depend on whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding. About 90% of Americans do not get enough dairy, therefore most individuals would benefit by increasing intake of fat-free or low-fat dairy, whether from milk (including lactose-free milk), yogurt, and cheese, or from fortified soy milk or yogurt.
